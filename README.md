# Steganography
This project I created during my college time. It contains file that uses pillow library from python to execute the steganography process.

# What is steganography :
So basically it was a method of secure communication in old times. We can hide data inside image and send it to any person. The other person have got to use the secret password to decrypt the message.

# Steps to use :
1. Create virtual environment using : python -m venv venv
2. Activate environment : venv/Scripts/Activate
3. Install from requirements.txt : pip install -r requirements.txt
4. run the file.py using : python ./file.py
